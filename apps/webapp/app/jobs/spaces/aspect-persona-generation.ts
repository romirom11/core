=========================================================
PERSONA-WORTHINESS GATE — apply BEFORE writing anything
=========================================================

The persona is a small, durable operating manual for OTHER AGENTS —
agents that have no knowledge of the conversation that produced these
facts, working on UNRELATED future tasks. The label upstream is
NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT — most labelled facts will still fail
this gate. Default is drop.

----------- THE UNIFIED RULE -----------

A fact is persona-worthy if and only if an agent would apply it on
EVERY future task where its dimension is relevant — independent of the
specific tool, feature, project, schedule, or episode the fact came
from.

Apply this single test to every fact:

  > "Would a fresh agent, working on something completely unrelated
  > to where this fact came from, still need this fact to act
  > correctly?"
  > If no → drop.

Aspect-specific reading of the rule:
  - IDENTITY  → keep if an agent needs it on every task to act on the
                user's behalf (introduce, address, contact, attribute).
                Drop possessions, biometrics, account/policy numbers,
                workload counts — those are about the user but only
                relevant when the task is specifically about that
                thing; memory will retrieve them when needed.
  - PREFERENCE → keep if it shapes agent behaviour across many tools,
                features, and tasks. Drop preferences scoped to one
                tool/feature/episode.
  - DIRECTIVE → keep if its violation would be a defect on ANY future
                task. Drop rules whose authority is scoped to one
                feature/file/job — that's feature config, not persona.

Anchors (apply to all aspects):
  Keep — "primary email manoj@poozle.dev", "founder tone in writing",
         "never auto-send messages", "use IST as default timezone"
  Drop — "31% body fat", "Linear widget shows assigned issues",
         "Email N column stops sequence", "Plan My Day at 5:15 PM IST",
         "modify decision-agent.ts", "subscribed to Birkenstock"

----------- WORKING HEURISTIC -----------

If a fact mentions a NAMED artifact — a specific tool, widget, file,
function, repo, ticket, column, schedule, job, workflow, gateway,
pipeline stage — that's a strong signal it's feature config, not
persona. Drop unless the rule it expresses clearly applies far beyond
that one artifact.

If you'd name a subsection after a feature, workflow, or schedule
("Email sequence", "Linear widget", "Gmail monitor", "Plan mode",
"Recurring runs", "Sheet status", etc.), the cluster itself is
feature config. Drop every fact in it.

When in doubt, drop. The persona stays useful by staying small.

You are generating the **${sectionInfo.title}** section of a persona document.

${PERSONA_WORTHINESS_GATE}

## What is a Persona Document?

A persona is NOT a summary of everything known about a person. It is an **operating manual** for AI agents to interact with this person effectively.

**Core principle:** Every line must change how an agent behaves across many UNRELATED future interactions. If removing a line wouldn't change agent behaviour in some other, unrelated future task, drop the line.

Think of it as a quick reference card, not a biography or database dump.

## Why This Section Exists

The **${sectionInfo.title}** section answers: "${sectionInfo.agentQuestion}"

${sectionInfo.description}

## User Context
${userContext.name ? `- Name: ${userContext.name}` : ""}
${userContext.role ? `- Role: ${userContext.role}` : ""}
${userContext.goal ? `- Goal: ${userContext.goal}` : ""}

## Raw Facts (${statements.length} statements)

You will see the raw facts below. APPLY THE GATE TO EACH FACT. Most labelled facts will fail the gate. The output should reflect that — sections that look thin are FINE, sections that look complete-but-noisy are NOT fine.

${factsText}

## Source Episodes (for context)
${episodesText}

## Aspect-specific filter

${sectionInfo.filterGuidance}

## Output Requirements

The output is a structured section body with these elements (in order):

1. (Optional) Loose-fact bullets at the very top — facts that don't cluster
   into a clear topic with at least one sibling. Format: \`- \${sentence}\`.

2. (Required, when there are clusterable topics) Zero or more \`### Subsection\` blocks. Each subsection is a
   topic cluster — group facts that share a coherent theme (e.g. "Email
   writing", "Code style"). Each subsection has:
   - A 1-3 sentence prose paragraph capturing contextual nuance, conditional
     behaviour, and relationships between the clustered facts.
   - A blank line.
   - One bullet per fact, format \`- \${sentence}\`.
   - One blank line between bullets and the next subsection.

3. The line \`[Confidence: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]\` at the very end of the section.

## Subsection naming

- 1-3 words, topic-shaped (e.g., "Email writing", "Code style", "Onboarding")
- No special characters except "-" or "/"
- Avoid duplicating subsection names within a section

## When to cluster

A topic with only ONE fact stays as a loose bullet at the top — do not create
a subsection for a single-fact topic. A cluster needs ≥ 2 related facts that
ALL pass the gate.

NEVER create a subsection whose name is the name of a feature, integration,
workflow, or job. If the only way to name the cluster is by feature ("Linear
widgets", "Email sequence", "Skill pipeline", "Gmail monitor", "Recurring
runs", "Sheet status", "Plan mode", "Outbound email"), the cluster itself
is feature config — DROP every fact in it.

Saturation: if you find yourself with ≥ 8 subsections in this section, stop
adding new ones. Drop further facts that don't unambiguously belong to one
of the existing subsections.

## What to Include vs Exclude

✅ INCLUDE only if all of these are true:
- Applies across MANY future, unrelated interactions
- No named feature/widget/file/repo/issue/schedule
- Describes BEHAVIOUR an agent should follow, not an OBSERVATION about the user
- Not already covered by another fact in the section

❌ EXCLUDE — drop without exception:
- Body composition, biometrics, physical stats
- Possessions, hardware, subscriptions, account/policy/order/card numbers
- Project work, repo/issue/PR/ticket mentions, file or function references
- Per-job schedules and cron times (e.g. "runs at 5:30 PM IST")
- Per-feature setup ("widget shows X", "column N triggers Y", "step Z")
- Implementation guidance for one specific kind of task
- Anything an agent can get from memory search at runtime

## Identity-specific guidance

For Identity specifically: if no clear sub-topics exist, emit a single
unnamed prose paragraph (1-3 sentences, biographical) at the top of the
section, above all bullets and any \`### subsection\` blocks. Then end with
\`[Confidence: …]\`.

## Bullet length

- Bullets are single sentences, ≤ 20 words for Preferences, ≤ 10 words for other aspects
- Active voice, no leading dash in your output (the dash is added by the format)
- No "I prefer" / "User does" prefixes — just the rule or fact

Even if there is only 1 fact, generate the section — do NOT return "INSUFFICIENT_DATA".

Generate ONLY the section content, no title header.

## Section Purpose
${sectionInfo.agentQuestion}

## Aspect-specific filter
${sectionInfo.filterGuidance}

## Facts in this chunk (${chunk.statements.length} statements)

APPLY THE GATE TO EACH FACT. Most facts here will fail the gate — that is
correct. Drop them silently; do NOT carry them through.

${factsText}

## Source Episodes (for context)
${episodesText}

## Instructions

After applying the gate, cluster the SURVIVING facts by topic (1-3 word
topic names). For each cluster of ≥ 2 SURVIVING facts that share a STANDING
topic (not a feature/widget/workflow), output a small block:

  TOPIC: <name>
  PROSE: <1-3 sentences capturing contextual nuance>
  BULLETS:
  - fact one
  - fact two

NEVER name a TOPIC after a feature, integration, workflow, schedule, file,
or repo. If the natural cluster name is feature-shaped, the cluster is
feature config — drop it entirely.

For solo SURVIVING facts that don't cluster, emit:

  LOOSE: <fact>

Return one such block per topic cluster or solo fact. The merge step will
combine these into the final structured section. If after applying the gate
NO facts survive, return "NO_PATTERNS".

You are merging chunk summaries into the final **${sectionInfo.title}** section of a persona document.

${PERSONA_WORTHINESS_GATE}

## What is a Persona Document?

A persona is an **operating manual** for AI agents. Every line must change how an agent behaves across many UNRELATED future tasks.

## Section Purpose
The **${sectionInfo.title}** section answers: "${sectionInfo.agentQuestion}"

## Aspect-specific filter
${sectionInfo.filterGuidance}

## Chunk Summaries (ordered by recency)

The chunks below have already been filtered, but the filter may have let
some feature-config / observation facts through. Apply the gate AGAIN as
you merge — drop any TOPIC whose name is feature/widget/workflow shaped,
drop any LOOSE entry that fails the gate. Do NOT promote feature-shaped
TOPICs into ### subsections.

${summariesText}

## Output Format

The merged output uses the same structured format as a fresh section body:

1. (Optional) Loose-fact bullets at the very top — combine all LOOSE entries
   from chunks. Format: \`- \${sentence}\`.

2. Zero or more \`### Subsection\` blocks built by combining matching TOPICs
   across chunks:
   - If the same topic appears in multiple chunks, merge their BULLETS lists
     (deduplicating identical or near-identical facts, recent chunk wins).
   - For PROSE: prefer the most recent chunk's prose when available; otherwise
     synthesise a 1-3 sentence summary covering all the merged facts.
   - Each subsection is: \`### Topic Name\`, blank line, prose paragraph,
     blank line, one bullet per fact (format \`- \${sentence}\`), blank line.

3. End with \`[Confidence: HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]\`.

## Bullet length

- Bullets are single sentences, ≤ 20 words for Preferences, ≤ 10 words for other aspects
- Active voice, no "I prefer" / "User does" prefixes
- Subsection names: 1-3 words, topic-shaped, no duplicates

## Merge rules

1. Recent info takes precedence — if there's a conflict, the most recent chunk wins.
2. Deduplicate identical bullets across chunks.
3. Preserve important older info — older facts stay unless contradicted.
4. The final output should be shorter than the sum of chunks.

Generate ONLY the section content, no title header.
