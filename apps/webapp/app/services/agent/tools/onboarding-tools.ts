/**
 * Integration + onboarding tools for the main agent. All three are
 * registered globally — the agent's prompt and each tool's description
 * tell it when calling makes sense. complete_onboarding is idempotent
 * (no-ops if onboarding is already complete) so there's no need to
 * conditionally register it.
 *
 * - list_available_integrations: returns the catalog of integration
 *   definitions the workspace can connect, with isConnected flags. The
 *   agent calls this before suggest_integrations to know which slugs
 *   are valid and to avoid suggesting things already connected. It reads
 *   IntegrationDefinitionV2 only — custom MCP servers live on
 *   user.metadata.mcpIntegrations and are reachable through the
 *   orchestrator, never through this catalog.
 *
 * - suggest_integrations: renders inline integration connect cards in
 *   the chat. The UI catches the tool call, looks up each slug's OAuth
 *   URL client-side, and renders a Connect button per card.
 *
 * - complete_onboarding: flips user.onboardingComplete = true and
 *   stores the final profile summary into user.metadata.onboardingSummary.
 *   Other metadata fields (timezone, personality, etc.) are preserved.
 *   Short-circuits with {already_complete: true} on re-calls.
